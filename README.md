To install Valentina, please visit our website [Valentina Website] and download the version that best suits your needs. Valentina supports two branches: `stable` and `dev`. Version numbers follow a specific pattern to indicate stability and development status:

- **Stable Version:**
  - Version numbers with even digits (e.g., 1.0) are reserved for stable releases.
  - Stable versions receive bug fixes to ensure a reliable and stable user experience.

- **Edge Version:**
  - Version numbers with odd digits (e.g., 1.1) represent the development branch.
  - The dev version is actively developed and receives bug fixes and new features, providing a more feature-rich experience.
  - While stable versions are suitable for initial checks, we recommend the dev branch for professional use due to its more advanced functionality.
